# Quick Start Guide

## For Deployment (Recommended for Playing with Friends in Scotland!)

Follow the simple 3-step process in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

**TL;DR:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render.com (free account)
3. Share the URL with your girlfriend!

## For Local Testing

Your server is already running! Just open:
```
http://localhost:3001
```

## What Was Set Up

✅ `package.json` - Tells cloud services how to run your app
✅ `.gitignore` - Prevents uploading unnecessary files
✅ `config.js` - Auto-detects if running locally or in production
✅ `simple-server.js` - Updated to serve your HTML files
✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
✅ `README.md` - Repository documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** (already working!)
2. **Push to GitHub** (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. **Deploy to Render** (free!)
4. **Share URL** with friends worldwide!
